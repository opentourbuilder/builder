# builder

The Evresi tour builder.

## Note for development
The tour builder needs some files bundled alongside its executable. On MacOS and Linux, these files
can be placed in a subdirectory of this directory named `install`. On Windows, these files must be
placed in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\EvresiBuilderDebugInstall`.
